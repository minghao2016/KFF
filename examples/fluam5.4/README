1. Installation instructions
---------------------------
a) You will need a NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 1.3
or higher to use fluam. You don't need any GPU to compile 
and modify the code.

b) Third-party software: you will need the CUDA compiler
nvcc and the CUDA libraries curand and cufft. You can obtain
them with the NVIDIA SDK package.

c) Edit the file fluam/bin/MakefileHeader line "LIBRARIES"
to include the right path to the CUDA libraries
and the HydroGrid code in case you have it. 
Set the right architecture for your GPU in 
"NVCCFLAGS".

d) Go to fluam/bin/ and type 
make


2. Use
------
To run fluam type
fluam data.main

data.main is a file with the option for the simulation, look
fluam/bin/data.main for the options.
